# Ultima-Adventures
A fork of Ultima Odyssey, A unique twist on Ultima Online - full server scripts, client link within

Scripts (both core and non-core) for the Ultima Adventures project.  I've worked on this project and maintained the code (with the help of many contributors) for the last three years (2020-2023).  It's been challenging, fun and now time for me to move on to other projects. 

I can't claim much of the code here, as a large portion of it was taken by public scripts and coded by Ultima Odyssey dev Djeryv, however the repo does have some pretty unique and itneresting systems like the soulbound system, red/blue AI, completely redone champ spawn AI, a from-scratch magery AI, etc etc.  I leave my contribution to this codebase to the open source community with the hopes that some of it may be of use to propagate and keep the Ultima Online legacy alive for new generations to enjoy.

Note that the code requires a custom client which can be downloaded at https://www.servuo.com/archive/ultima-adventures-a-full-featured-content-packed-offline-online-server.1374/

All the best to the UO community, I hope to keep playing this amazing game for many more years to come.  Feel free to clone and revise as you wish!
