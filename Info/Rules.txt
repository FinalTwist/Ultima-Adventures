- Although this world has the potential for player versus player combat, this does not give you the right to harass others on a constant basis.

- Although you shouldn't be harassed on a constant basis, player versus player combat can be a reality. The world is very large and there are many places to go where you may never be found. There are about 8 different worlds and over 80 dungeons. Some lands are so huge that one may never find where you built your house.

- Killing citizens will increase your murder count, and not just killing other player characters.

- If your character's name is something like TacoChamp123 or Batman, it will eventually be changed for you to something else.

- Digging up graves is a criminal offense.

- Although death knights are rare, it is illegal to be one in a settlement once you are too powerful. You will be attacked and perhaps killed on sight.

- Any criminals (gray in color) or murderers (often red in color) will be unwelcome in settlements and often killed on sight.

- Public areas are safe havens for everyone. These areas include the banks, inns, taverns, secret guilds, and the lost glade.

- If you find any glitches, email the administrator and let them know so they can be addressed. There is no GM on staff so paging is not used here.
