  <a name="additions"></a>Original Additions<br>
  - Command &quot;ExportUOL&quot; Designed to take all the statics including checking 
  some of the statics to make sure it was a static before exporting. Scripted 
  by DKnight<br>
  - Using the power of XML UO Landscaper uses these XML files to import your exported 
  statics to create on compiling your map, so everytime you wanted to fix something 
  on you map without altering any of your statics you could do so.<br>
</p>
<p>Ravenal's Additions<br>
  - Command &quot;AreaExportUOL&quot; Designed to target a bounding box area to 
  export into a xml file.<br>
  - You can now do [AreaExportUOL &lt;Filename&gt; or [ExportUOL &lt;Filename&gt; 
  for example: [AreaExportUOL DessertTown-Dock and this will create a file in 
  the certain directory which is editable on top of the ExportUOL.cs script, Example 
  below.</p>
<p> <font color="#FF0000">private const string ExportPath = @&quot;C:\Documents 
  and Settings\Owner\My Documents\UOLandscaper\Exports&quot;;</font></p>
<p> - When Exporting at anytime, there will be a warning gump to warn you if you 
  wish to do this, don't say we didn't warn you.</p>
<p>Future Possible Additions<br>
  - ImportUOL, will import all the XML files inside your ExportPath and such, 
  this will have a warning gump before you import<br>
  - ImportUOL &lt;Filename&gt;, will import a specific filename you requested, 
  that is within your ExportPath.</p>

<p> <a name="directions"></a>DIRECTIONS</p>
<p> Directions on how to Export your Statics and use it in UO Landscaper.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Check your ExportPath to make sure it is the directory you wish to target. 
    If it doesn't exist it will automatically create it, make sure you fix this 
    when you first get this script.</li>
  <li>Use either the [ExportUOL or [AreaExportUOL command with &lt;filename&gt; 
    or not to your choice.</li>
  <li>When exporting into the xml file, there will be a warning gump, make sure 
    you say okay or cancel if your unsure about this.</li>
  <li>When the 3 steps above are complete, goto your ExportPath and grab those 
    files, I would just &quot;Copy&quot; those files, and then place them into 
    your UO Landscaper Project Folder, For example of what I have is,</li>
</ol>
<p> <font color="#0000FF">C:\Documents and Settings\Owner\My Documents\UOLandscaper\Paragonix\Map3\Import 
  Files</font></p>
<ol>
  <li>Always make sure in your project folder you have the folder name called 
    Import Files, if it doesn't exist right click on your mouse and create a new 
    folder naming it &quot;Import Files&quot;. Within your Project Folder.</li>
  <li>After that do the following steps on how to create your map it then should 
    import those XML within the Import Files folder within your Project Folder, 
    and add it to the statics0.mul or statics2, 3 or even 4. It will also do the 
    staidx files too</li>
</ol>
<p>FIXED BUGS - None at this time...</p>
