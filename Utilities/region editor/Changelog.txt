Changes in Version 1.1:
* Fixed problems that required the application to be restarted after setting your mul
  file path and path to regions.xml.
* The application will now track when changes are made and ask you if you want to save
  changes when you close the application.
* The original regions.xml file will be backed up as regions.xml.bck_{timedatestamp)
  so you can restore any previous version of the file if needed.
* Altered the application to require .NET Framework 2.0 to comply with other applications
  and utilities available. The application previously required .NET Framework 4.0.
* Cleaned up some internal coding to make record tracking more efficient.

Changes in Version 1.2:
* Minor cosmetic changes in how the large map view is displayed.
* Changed the alpha highlight for region selection from orange to yellow.
* Modified the region type field to only allow characters that would be valid to use
  as a class name. This allows you to specify region types that may be custom to your
  shard. The drop-down of the combobox still contains the predefined region types in
  the RunUO SVN.

Changes in Version 1.4:
* Corrected errors that would cause the Region Editor to lose track of the number of
  regions on a facet when removing them.
* Added the ability to allow users to go directly to a specified location on the map.
* Added the ability to allow users to manually enter the coordinates and size of
  new areas if an area was not highlighted.
* Added a button that allows the user to remove all regions from the current facet.
  This is ideal for shards that are compiling regions for an entirely custom map.

Changes in Version 1.5:
* Fixed bug that would allow you to scroll the map beyond the visible area showing No Draw tiles.
* Added a compatibility option in the Options menu that will allow compatibility with older
  clients that only use map0.mul with a size of 6144x4096.
* Removed the 'Set Z Min' button and replaced it with a 'Modify Area' button.  This
  button allows you to modify all the settings on the area including the Z Min.

Changes in Version 1.6:
* Significantly improved the display and scrolling speed of the main map display.

Changes in Version 1.7:
* Added additional levels of scale reduction.
* Added the ability to double-click on the main display to center the display at the selected point.
