Functionality:
==============

This program helps you with creating new animations for Ultima Online.
You can load bitmaps into the gui, place them, and then save it to a 
*.uop patch file. These patch files can be imported into the verdata 
with the program "Michelangelo".


Basic Operations:
=================

* hit the "Add Animation" button to create a new animation frame. 
  you'll be prompted to enter a name and a block number. the name 
  is unimportant and for intenal usage only. the block number is the 
  animation frame ID (which IS important). more than one animation 
  can be handled.
* then use the "Add Image" button to add bitmaps to your animation. 
* when a bitmap is selected, it will be displayed in the client area. 
  you can use the arrow buttons to move the image around. the cross 
  indicates the (0,0) coordinates for this animation. also, the two 
  lines in the upper right corner tell you the current center_x and 
  center_y values of the displayed image.
* when you are done, press "Create Patch" to save your animation(s) 
  to an *.uop patch file.



the "Open Patch" button is not working right now. it is supposed to 
open an *.uop file and display it's content. i am still working on that.

this program is a new approach to giving my DOS-based animation editor 
a windows interface. the old "anim_edit_win.zip" prog will not get 
updated anymore, since it's code is quite messed up....

please play around with this prog, and tell me what you think.
