Mystical Sextant Quest.
Created by Skarth.
RunUO 2.0 adaptation dy Dereckson.

This will guide you through the set-up process. It's pretty basic. You just add mobiles at key
	locations that I will give you. You will also add spawners at other locations that I
	will give you (I'm assuming you know how to set up your spawner system). An overview
	of the quest is below the instructions.

SET-UP
	At the locations given, make sure you're on the Trammel map and type the following:
		[go XXX YYY ZZZ
	....where XXX, YYY, and ZZZ are the location numbers given for each mobile and spawner.
