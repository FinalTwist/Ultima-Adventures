Pirates Of The Carrabean Quest + Loch Ness Monster Quest 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Well its finished but i might end up adding more to it.

Its just a small quest where u start by talking to Captian Jack Sparrow who was thieving one day and Peg Leg Pete stole his weapon he wants you to kill Peg Leg but doesnt know where he is and return with his head.

He tells you to go find Captian Barbosa and ask him for his location. Barbosa tells you he wants a piece of Cortez Gold (which u spawn somewhere) and you get the gold give to barbosa and he gives you Peg Leg's Riddle Diary which has a little riddle in it of his location (riddle tells you its at destard) then you kill peg leg get his head give it to sparrow and he rewards you with Peg Legs Hook (which is a boneharvestor)

You guys will have to edit for your shard because the location that barbosa says where the gold is would be different ect. 

 Have Fun
