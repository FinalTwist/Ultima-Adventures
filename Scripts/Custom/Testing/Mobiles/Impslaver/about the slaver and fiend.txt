the ice fiend lord is an evil so and so, not only does he spawn new ice imps
he also turns you into a cute froggie lol... hes a good fight slightly above
the ice fiend.. carries a new bow for the archer

the imp slaver is the same guy as above but the balron but again only above the ice fiend stats,
he spawns normal imps nasty wee things, if he touches you you turn into a chicken
he holds a new peace of armour ie gloves for the tamer types.

If you player dies then he dies in the form of the chicken or frog.
