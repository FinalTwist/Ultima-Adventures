From these stories grew the legends of the magic shrines of Ambrosia. The land prospered as the years passed, and the strange power grew in strength.

The Stranger freed the Serpent, allowing it to return but the effects are still felt. Chaos and Order still battle amongst each other in the void, and Order seems to be winning. The power of Chaos was accidentally released and possessed three poor souls.

A gypsy in Lodor told me that I would need three unique items if I am ever to defeat all of the Chaos Banes. I will need to find the Orb of Logic if I am to defeat the Bane of Insanity. One has to acquire the Scales of Ethicality if they ever hope to defeat the Bane of Anarchy. Lastly, we need to find the Lantern of Discipline to slay the Bane of Wantoness.

This particular demon is believed to be from the Ethereal Plane.

She warned me to be careful if I manage to get a flask full of this strange liquid. If I spill it, it would cover the ground and be as harmful as if it spew forth from the monster from which I got it from.

He was to capture the essences of beings known as the Banes of Chaos, which the Guardian would unleash on Sosaria. Being hungry for power, Batlin was going to use the Banes to seize power himself, but something happened and they were freed from their magical prison. Possessing three of Batlin's followers, the Banes killed Batlin and fled to their own areas of the Serpent Island. This had far reaching consequences, as some of the creatures were becoming cursed by the Banes' influence. Some adventurers have spoken of these cursed monsters, and how mightier they became once cursed. Many have perished by these beasts, but those that defeated them sometimes returned with treasure beyond belief.

It possesses a force field that can alternate between magic and melee protection. It also emits beams of energy that electrify the soul. Why would one attempt to face such a being?

The information within the core is not what I seek, but destroying the core to unleash its power is. I have found the ancient gargoyle city of stone in the Savaged Empire, but I have yet to find the Forge of Virtue within, where I must plunge the core. If what the gargoyles speak of is true, an item placed on the Shrine of Diligence will absorb the power of the core when it is destroyed. I must also speak the magical mantra of 'Vas An Ort Ailem', and throw the core into the forge. The shrine is said to be next to the forge, but finding it means nothing if I cannot track down where Exodus will be next. The lands are so vast that finding him will prove to be quite difficult.

This island had the look and feel of pure evil. An old man on board told us tales of pirates that came to this island for a safe haven, but were cursed to live among the dead that roam woods. The mountains were dark, the soil was mud, and the trees were blackened as if burned. A pale figure approached us on the dock and took possession of the crate. His hands were white as clean bone and his voice was eerie sounding. He tossed us a sack of the remaining gold and we went on our way. We made sail as fast as we could back home. We barely left the sight of that place when a ship came at us from the east. The wood was a ghostly white and we could make out some shuffling around the deck. As the ship approached, the horror became more real. This was a barge of the dead. They boarded our vessel and killed almost every man on board. They didn't take any plunder, but instead sunk the Blue Wave into the sea. Only, Vrendora, Selena, and I survived. We floated at sea for days until Captain Feldora rescued us in her ship, the Velvet Sky. Upon our return to the Port of Dusk, Vrendora soon went mad and was killed by the local guards.

Then the priests would collect this gold and distribute it among the poor and less fortunate. One knight did not believe in this mantra. He wanted all the wealth he could collect, often killing others for theirs. His soul was so corrupted, that his powers of chivalry were slowly darkened and twisted into something putrid and evil. He donned black armor and terrorized villages and cities to take what they had. Knights were sent to dispatch this traitor of the faith, but many died.

It was decided that she would be put to death before any of this were to come to be. They dragged her to the altar, tied her to it, and summoned the demon that would take her soul to the underworld.

She fled to the tropical island to the north with nothing but a small raft. She found a cave there where she took shelter for days, eating roots and berries she foraged. As she aged, so did her power. The island was slowly turned into a frozen tundra. The cave she lived in had walls of ice, building smoothing hallways.

Some of our brothers and sisters have left our order, in pursuit of evil. What corrupts their minds is that of power over others. They no longer care for the balance of the world, but their own greed.<br><br>This was most evident on the island of Kuldar. That baneful wizard Vordo convinced the local druids to join his legions of magic users, and then the demons and corrupt satyrs joined the ranks. We were to deal with this growing threat, but when we sailed to the island, it was gone. We sailed the seas for days thinking we perhaps had the wrong coordinates, but it as if it never existed. We returned home, with no further rumors of Vordo or his evil druids. Some say that Vordo unleashed a spell that doomed them all, sinking the island to the bottom of Neptune’s depths.

Ancient wizards would sometimes have these shards, but they are either long dead or joined the ranks of the dead. I found such a crystal, and I hope to learn the secrets of shard. I learned that if I can free the daemon, they would owe me a life debt for their freedom, and would accompany me without restraint. I know I have to find some shards of power in order to meld them with this crystal and would thus shatter.<br><br>I will consult the sages to learn the location of these other shards, but I need to know what type of daemon I am dealing with. I found an ancient scroll that gives me a clue. If I can make it to the Isles of Dread, and commandeer a ship, I can sail to the island where the Blood Temple lies. There I should be able to remove the first protective magics that cover this shard in secrecy. There, I should find the vortex of blood and stand within it.

Their motives are the most vile in nature, and perhaps could be compared with the goals of demons and devils. They wish to only create chaos where there is peace, and rule over those from the shadows. They slay those that stand in their way, and take what they want to meat their ends.

Get the plans for that new space station that is being built so we can then find a weakness and strike a devastating blow for the Syth. Two of us managed to infiltrate Captain Gadberry’s ship and download the data, but his ship crashed here on this planet. After the crash, the theory traversing the decks was that a stranger took too much fuel from the main ship’s reserves. This supposedly caused the orbit to decay. We were soon discovered by security and Master Malak and I fled the wreckage and managed to avoid pursuit in the forest. We setup a beacon for evacuation, but fear that we are too far in the galaxy to have the signal picked up by our order.<br><br>We spent many years exploring the land and learning the cultures. Some of these people, often called wizards, seem to have a power similar to us. The way they call it forth, however, is more ritualistic than the sheer psychic forces we command. They use a series of herbs and trinkets, along with words and gestures to unleash these forces. Although different, they have similar effects and have often matched our own strength of will. We searched for items of similar power, in the hopes that one can get us off this rock. We never found such an item.<br><br>It was decided to increase our ranks on this planet, by finding those that have the talent to become a Syth. If we cannot leave, then perhaps we should rule. Malak decided to cultivate a relationship with a group of death knights. Ten were allowed in the Syth order, as they had similar methodologies to our own so teaching them the Syth ways was of little difficulty. We were a disease unleashed on the land, and we brought the mightiest to their knees. This, however, brought forth new dilemmas.<br><br>The death knights became hungry for power. So much in fact that they began to betray us as well as each other. Their greed is what killed my master, and fractured the collective whole. Soon the holy knights of the land hunted them down and slain each in turn. The ten followers are dead now, buried in tombs throughout the lands. I laid Malak to rest in the Fires of Hell, and built a statue in his honor. I entombed him with his datacron, which could hold the knowledge of the Syth if one seeks it. After being slain by the death knights, each of the ten took a piece of Malak’s knowledge with them. So his datacron now contains very little information and I have no desire to restore it. It is locked away, however, and I need only speak the words ‘Anakasu Arrii Venaal’ to release it from its resting place if I ever change my mind.<br><br>So now I remain, the last Syth on this primitive planet. Gadberry never repaired his ship and it was deserted the last time I went to the crash site. Ship logs showed that the survivors went off to settle the land and live out their lives. I grow weary and old, but I did find an apprentice to pass my knowledge to. I will instill the rule of one, where only one Syth should be. Any more than one could lead to the destruction of the order in its entirety as greed and power will cause us to kill each other to be the ultimate ruler. Once I feel they are ready, they will help me end my life and pursue their own agenda until they need to pass on their knowledge to another. They will need to begin learning the concepts of evaluating intelligence (10 points at least) and have negative karma if they ever want to claim Malak's datacron. They would then need to master the skills of swords and tactics if they wish to have the most power at their fingertips. I will rest now, and I'll see how they do."; }

One may find some unusual weapon or armor that is no longer usable, but can be decorative for a wealthy home or castle. Other rare items could be found in the forms of leather, furs, cloth, liquors, reagents, jewelry, or mystical items from long dead wizards. Others may be decorative clocks, vases, statues, or paintings of people and scenery from long ago. These items are often kept by adventurers as trophies for their adventures. Others would rather barter for gold of such items. One that is good with item lore can usually determine the value of such items, and who in the settlements may want the items. Those that are not good at item lore or identification can usually guess who may want the item. These items cannot be simply sold to these collectors, but instead one would just give them the item and the citizen will give them an appropriate amount of gold.
