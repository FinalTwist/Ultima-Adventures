I myself am making sweet rolls for the grand dinner tonight. I better get to work.<br><br>Entry 2 - The celebration did not go well. Mangar was there and he was threatening many of the council members. Apparently there is some legend of a lost artifact in ruins below Skara Brae, and he wants permission to dig. The council is weak, but with the backing of Lord British...Mangar can do very little to force them into his demands. He eventually stormed off to his tower. I will ask the council if they want me to scout out his tower tomorrow. It is in the center of Sosaria, so it will be a far walk...but I think we need to know what he is up to.<br><br>Entry 3 - I am off with the council's blessing. It will be a long journey, but I should be there early tomorrow. I have setup camp and am ready to rest for the night.<br><br>Entry 4 - I am back in Skara Brae, as I traveled all night to get here. Matters are getting worse. Mangar was not in his tower when I got there, but I scaled the walls and searched his study. There were many scrolls and books. From what I could read, he is planning something horrific for us. His plan is to magically transport Skara Brae into the Void. If he were to accomplish this, then we would not be able to get outside help and Mangar can do with Skara Brae as he pleases. I went over this with the council tonight and they sent a messenger to Britain for help.<br><br>Entry 5 - Mangar arrived in Skara Brae this morning and has been in with the council since he got here. I went over to the building to eavesdrop on the conversation. He urged the council to meet his demands to dig. If they do not, he would unleash horrific magic on us and send us into the Void. When one of the council members stated that Lord British's wizards would come find us and return us from the Void...that is when Mangar said, 'No one in Sosaria will ever know we are in the Void'. What does that mean?<br><br>Entry 6 - I returned to Mangar's tower in a hope to put an end to his tyranny. He was not there yet again, and the tower seemed to be unkempt to say the least. Searching through more scrolls, I found out what he meant the other day. His plan is to make it appear Skara Brae lies in ruins. All of Sosaria will think we perished in some type of disaster. I must return and warn the others. <br><br>Entry 7 - I am too late. Skara Brae is gone, and there is nothing but destroyed homes around me. I am sitting on the floor of what was once my home, bleeding out from a knife wound to my back. Distracted by the magical vortex earlier, Mangar crept up behind me and stabbed me. He then teleported away with a sinister laugh. It appears he has won. May the gods help all of those trapped in Skara Brae."; }

It also helps to have skills in alchemy and necromancy when performing these tasks. Forensics is needed to know what ingredients to use. Alchemy is needed to actually mix the ingredients together. Necromancy is required to use the potions you make from this process. To get started, you need to get a mixing cauldron. These can be created by tinkers, but you may also be able to buy them from necromancers and alchemists. You need to get a cauldron mixer. This is a large wooden stirring device that you can also maybe get from necromancers and alchemists. Carpenters can make these as well. You can only mix a certain amount of liquids before the acidic nature of brewing will slowly eat away at the wood. This type of alchemy needs a few items. You will need either body parts or bones, which can usually be found digging graves. You will need a skin of water. You will also need a magical reagent. These are items like black pearl, garlic, or bloodmoss. To make the more powerful potions, you may be required to find a rare magical reagent. These are items like dragon teeth, silver serpent venom, lich dust, or unicorn horns. Lastly, you will need two unique items extracted from dead creatures. To extract these special items from dead creatures, you will need to use your forensics skill and get a surgeons knife. You can usually buy these from healers, but tinkers can also make them. Make sure to bring along empty jars to collect what you find. Double click the knife and target a corpse. If your skill is good enough, you will get something special off of a corpse with the surgeons knife. These items can be sold to alchemists for profit, or you can use them in your necrotic alchemy. This process follows a series of steps. You need to be next to a fire source such as an oven or fire pit. Double click the cauldron and it will ask you to pick a special item you carved off a corpse. Double click again to select a second, unique item to add. Double click again to be asked to pick a magical reagent. Double click again to select a body part you need, and then a waterskin to the mixture. Lastly, double click again to select the mixing device you will use. You may succeed or you may fail at making anything. If you want to abandon your efforts, double click the cauldron and select yourself to dump it all out. The chaotic nature of necrotic alchemy is that each cauldron is unique. As you brew potions, the metal gets seasoned to the ingredients you cook in it. As you figure out how to brew potions in that cauldron, it will be seasoned in the metal of the cauldron. There are a total of 16 potions one can learn to create doing this. To see which potions a cauldron is seasoned with, double click the cauldron and target itself to get a listing of recipes. If you lose your cauldron, you will have to start the entire process all over again. When you succeed at making a batch of potions, the amount of jars you can fill with it depends on how good your alchemy, forensics, and necromancy is. If you have a cauldron with liquid, you can double click the cauldron and select an empty jar to fill. These potions cannot be stored in wooden kegs due to their acidic nature. Necromancers who create these mystical brews increase their power greatly. With these potions, necromancers will be able to see in the dark, cure poisons, open locks, cause disease, mark runes, teleport, open magical gates, create ghostly images of themselves, and even bring those back from the dead. Unlike normal potions, these elixirs are commonly splashed onto something else and not drunk."; }

One must be proficient in cooking in order to know what plants to pick for herbalism. It also helps to have skills in alchemy when creating potions from such plants. Those closest to the ways of the old druids are ones that have achieved a great skill in animal lore. To get started, one must get a pair of gardening shears from a cook, druid, or herbalist. A tinker can also make you a pair of these. Take the shears and find plants to trim from. You can trim from bushes, mushrooms, grasses, and many other types of plants. You can collect many types of herbs to use, but you need to get an herbalist cauldron to mix them together. These can also be purchased from the before listed merchants or crafted by tinkers. You need to get a cauldron mixer as well. This is a large wooden stirring spoon when mixing ingredients in the cauldron. Carpenters can make these but the merchants already discussed probably sell them as well. You can only mix a certain amount of liquids before the wood loses firmness and needs to be replaced.

			else if ( book is LoreGuidetoAdventure ){ book.BookText = "Playing " + Server.Misc.ServerList.ServerName + " is pretty simple as the interface is quite intuitive. Although the game is over 20 years old, some explanation is in order. After you login and are in the game world, you will see a book open with abilities. Right click on this book to make it close as you will not need it for this game. Almost any window can be closed with a right click. Your character is always in the center of the playing screen. To travel, simply move the mouse over the game world display... then right click and hold. The mouse cursor will always point away from your character, who will move in the indicated direction (for example, if you wish to walk up the screen, hold the cursor above your character). You will continue to head in that direction until you come to an obstruction or release the mouse button. The further away the cursor is from your character, the faster the character will move. Double right clicking will cause your character to move to the exact point where the cursor was... unless disabled in the options.<br><br>PAPERDOLL: Your character paperdoll will be open when you start. If it is not, pressing Alt P will open it for you. Below I will explain what this does. The left side shows boxes for the slot showing what is on your head, then the slot showing what is on your ears, then the slot showing what is on your neck, then the slot showing what is on your finger, lastly the slot showing what is on your wrist. The bottom will show your name and your title. Sometimes it is custom, while mostly it is your best practiced skill along with any fame and/or karma you gained. The right side has various buttons. Pressing the HELP button brings up a simple help menu. The only thing that you should ever use here is when your character is physically stuck in the game world and needs to be teleported out. It will teleport you into a safe area somewhere in the land. The OPTIONS button will bring up your options for the game (discussed later). The LOG OUT button Logs you out of the game. Make sure you are in a safe place. The STATS button will bring up some vital stats about your character (discussed later). The SKILLS button will bring up all of the skill available in the game. Here you manage your skill progression (discussed later). The GUILD button enables you to start your own guild. It will cost money to get started, but you can invite other players and share homes and chat with each other. The PEACE button toggles whether you are ready to fight... or not. Lastly, the STATUS button will bring up the status of your character (discussed later). The center shows your character. Here you can drag and drop clothing, armor, and other equipment worn by your character. Double click the left scroll to see how old your account is. Double click the right scroll to organize a party of other players. This is important if you plan to share the rewards of dungeon delving. Double click the backpack to open your backpack (discussed later).<br><br>MENU BAR: This menu bar can allow you to get access to certain items quicker. It can be disabled in the options. The small triangle will minimize the menu bar. The MAP button will open a mini map of your surrounding area. Pressing it a second time will make the map a bit larger (Alt R does this as well). The PAPERDOLL button will open your paperdoll. The INVENTORY button will open your backpack (discussed later). The JOURNAL button will open your journal, which shows the most recent things you saw or heard. The CHAT button does not work as the chat option is disabled. Type the command [c instead. The HELP button will bring up the help menu that was already discussed. The ? button brings up a very outdated information screen. It is best not to use it.<br><br>BACKPACK: When you double click the backpack on the paperdoll, it will open (Alt I will do that as well). You can only carry a certain amount of weight based off of your strength. If you strength is extremely high, then you are at the mercy at how much the backpack can actually hold. The image on the right shows how you can actually have containers within the backpack to help organize things better. You can drag and drop items between the containers. Sometimes your containers will close when you travel between different worlds. If you close a container, that has other container from within it open, those containers will also close. OPTIONS Pressing the options button will open this window (as will pressing Alt O). You can change many things in the options section. You can control the volume of music and sounds. You can change the fonts and colors of such fonts. You can setup macros to create shortcut keys for commonly used series of commands. You can also filter obscenities. This is also where you can set your pathfinding, war mode, targeting system, and menu bar options. You can choose to offset your interface windows (like containers) when opening. Pay attention to the macro options, as you can learn about some of the pre built shortcut keys... along with learning how to steer ships when you can afford to buy one.<br><br>STATS: There are many aspects of your character, and the stats button will display this for you. You can see what comprises of your abilities and if you have any bonuses to regeneration of statistics like mana, stamina, or hit points. You can see the values of your karma and fame (which can also appear as a title on your paperdoll). Your hunger and thirst will be shown so you can determine if you need to eat or drink (of course, the game will tell you when you are starving or dying of thirst without this statistic). You can tell how fast you can cast spells or apply bandages. If you murdered anybody innocent, you can see that value here. If you use tithing points (people doing chivalry), you can see that value here to know if you need to make a donation of gold to a shrine sooner or later.<br><br>SKILLS: Pressing the skills button will open this (as will pressing Alt K). Here you can see the many skills available in the game for your character to become proficient at. You can learn all skills in the game as there is no total limit (skillcap). The skill with the blue dots to the left are skills that are activated to use most of the time (meaning, sometimes they are working in the background as well). For these skills, you can click and drag them off of this scroll and it will make a button on your screen that you can click on to activate the skill in the future. To the right of each value is an up arrow that you can change to a down arrow or a lock. You can lock a skill at a certain value so it does not raise or lower any more than that. You can change it to a down arrow as well. This will tell the game that this skill will decrease if another skill raises (and you have used up all 1,000 points). You can see the example on the right. The lower right number of 193. 1 indicates that this character has used that many skill points so far. Some magic items add to your skills and will be reflected here. If you just want to see the skill values (without the addition that magic items provide), click on the 'show real' option on the bottom right. The 'show caps' option will show you the maximum value you can have a skill at. Each skill is allowed to go up to 100 each (you can have as many skills as you wish, there is no total cap/limit). You can find scrolls of power that will allow a skill to go above 100, and this option will show you that. Skills are organized by category and you can even click the 'new group' button to make a group of your own. Then you can drag and drop skills in this 'group' so you can select a particular set of skills you may want to keep your eye on for that character.<br><br>STATUS: The status window shows your character's strength, dexterity, intelligence, hit points, stamina, mana, luck, carried weight, followers, damage, and carried gold. You can also see the maximum value you are allowed for strength, dexterity, and intelligence (always 250). Double clicking this window will switch it from a detailed view to a smaller bar view. You can set your strength, dexterity, and intelligence to raise and lower similar to skills described above... with the arrows on the left of each value. On the very right is your values of defense against physical, fire, cold, poison, and energy. All creatures have these values and some attacks deal damage in all or some of these categories. You will one day want all of these values high (maximum of 70% in each). The rest of the game features can be learned while in the game. As an example, you can learn some more commands from the message of day. You can also visit a sage and buy a scroll that will detail what all of the skills do and how to use them. Many commands you can type in the bottom left of the world view window by typing a '[' symbol (without quotes)... along with the command. For example, '[c' will bring up the chat window. '[status' will bring up the stats window. '[motd' will bring up the message of the day. On the message of the day window, press the ? on the upper right to learn more commands. It will be up to you and explore. Now lets get into some of the common things that you will probably do in the game.<br><br>CHAT: This is a means to communicate within the game world when you are not on the same screen as another player. Type '[c' to begin using the chat system. This also lets you send a message to another player that they can read later on. Keep in mind that this is character specific and not account specific. If you send a message to a character, but the player logs in with a different character, they will not see the message until they log in with 'that character'. This chat feature has many options Internet chat systems have. You can see who is online. You can establish channels. You can even set some privacy levels to ignore others or not be seen at all.<br><br>CITIZENS: Many citizens have a context menu when you single left click them. This brings up a list of services they provide for you. Some may be grayed out as being something they cannot provide 'you' in particular (if they train tailoring for example, and you are already a master at it, it will be grayed out because they cannot teach you any more about it). Many citizens have a 'hire' option. Make sure to explore what you can hire them to do for you. It may come in handy later. Be careful when single left clicking them as you may still be in war mode and accidentally attack them. If they live through your initial attack, run away or risk becoming a murderer. Murders take about 40 hours of real time (while in game) to go away. You will not be allowed in a settlement while being a murderer. Criminals on the other hand will lose their criminal status in a few minutes.<br><br>BANKS: Banks are a safe place in which to leave your valuables. You can't carry everything with you and this does nicely until you can afford a home. Also, the world is dangerous. You will want to keep extra equipment in the bank in case you lose your favored set. Bankers are attentive and if you simply go into the building and say 'bank', they will give you access to your bank box. Banks are the only place that will take your non gold currency and exchange it for gold. You will find copper and silver coins out there and you need them converted. Giving them to a banker will do this. You can also put the coins in your bank box and double click them. This will convert them as well. If you need to carry a large amount of gold somewhere, you can convert funds to an official document called a check. To do this, simply say the word 'check' and the amount.<br><br>INNS & TAVERNS: Inns (candle signs) and Taverns (wine/grape signs) are the safe places for adventurers to rest and relax. You cannot cast spells here or attack anyone else. These places are good to negotiate trades, buy food and drink, or simply chat and play the games that they offer (the tavern offers games... not inns). You log out instantly when in these places, otherwise... it will take a few minutes for your character to log out when out and about. Taverns are a good place to hire henchman to adventure with as well. Sometimes there are also bar patrons in taverns that will tell of places to go and rumors they heard.<br><br>PRACTICE: Some settlements have a place for you to practice your weapon skills. Equip a weapon by putting it in your paperdoll hand and then double click a training dummy. You can only train a weapon skill so high on these, but it will get you started. For ranged weapons, use an archery butte to practice with. If you are able to find a thief, they usually have dummies that you can practice pick pocketing with.<br><br>COMBAT: To start a fight with someone (or something), press the peace button on the paperdoll to go into war mode. Then double click a target. You will now be in a fight. Remember to press the button again to go back to peace mode, so you don't accidentally attack anyone. Most weapons need you toe to toe with your opponent, while bows allow you to be a bit of a distance away. You can also attack with followers or spells. Casting a harmful spell on another will start a fight as well. Keep in mind, there are times you may need to run away from a fight. It is better to live and fight another day. Killing citizens or other players will give you murder counts. The exception is when you kill another player that is already a murderer or criminal. You can tell when you highlight them. If they are red, they are a murder. If they are grey, they are a criminal.<br><br>WEAPONS: There are many different weapons in the game. Hovering your cursor over them will show you the statistics of the weapon. You can see the damage it causes and type of damage. You can see how often you can swing the weapon (or shoot). There will be a strength requirement to use the weapon, along with the skill type when using the weapon (swordsmanship, archery, etc). The weapon will indicate if it is a one or two handed weapon. This is important if you want to hold a shield, torch, or lantern. Two handed weapons do not allow for that. Some weapons will have magical properties that will also be listed in this manner. Each weapon has a durability. You item will break if it gets too low so you either need to fix it yourself (usually with blacksmithing or bowcrafting skills) or find a citizen you can hire to fix it for you.<br><br>ARMOR: Armor not only covers the medieval metal armors of knights, but also the minor items like leather gloves and hats. If you look to the right, you can see the wizard's hat has some bonuses to resistances (see the section on Status). Armor has a strength requirement and durability like weapons do. You can buy many pieces of armor that go over many sections of the body. Areas like hands, arms, legs, neck, chest, and head can all have some type of armor worn on it. You can equip them like a weapon or jewelry. Drag and drop the piece of armor on the paperdoll. If it does not equip, you are either not strong enough or you have a piece of armor or clothing in that spot already. The heavier the armor, the less likely you can meditate or sneak around. Leather armor is usually good for doing such things, where even switching to studded leather armor may be too heavy. Any armor showing as 'mage armor' will allow you to meditate or sneak no matter the weight.<br><br>MAGIC GATES: You may come across a magic gate that leads elsewhere. Nothing to do but walk away or go in. They come in different colors of blue, red, or black. Powerful wizards can summon these gates while some necromantic potions can summon black gates. If you learn where these gates go, you will be able to explore new worlds or get around the current world much quicker. Sometimes, slaying a mystical creature will create a gate, but those are very... very rare.<br><br>MAGIC RUNES: Recall runes are small brown stones with a golden ankh symbol on them that one may cast a Mark Spell on. This will mark the current location of rune to that spot. One may use magic to then transport back to that spot. When runes are marked, they will change color depending on the world they go to. You can buy/make runebooks that will allow you to drop a rune stone in for easier use. You are allowed 16 per book. Dropping Recall Spell scrolls onto the book will increase the charges so you can use the book to simply teleport to those locations without knowing magic.<br><br>BOOKS OF MAGIC: There are a few books of magic in the world. The one wizards use is a simple spellbook while necromancers use a necromancer spellbook. Both of these books need spell scrolls scribed in them by dropping the appropriate spell scroll on the book. You can double click a scroll and try to cast from it, but it would simply fade afterwards. Putting it in a book lets you keep using it over and over. The other three books are for chivalry, samurai, and ninjas. They are not like spellbooks as they are simply books that allow you to use those special abilities. No matter the book, you can drag and drop icons from them so you have a quicker way to cast/use them. The wizard and necromancer spells require spell components. You can also visit a sage or scribe for even easier ways to use this magic.<br><br>DEATH: You might find yourself falling under a series of unfortunate events... and thus leave the land of the living. Fear not! You can return in a couple of different ways. The first choice is to resurrect with certain penalties to your skills and abilities. This is quick, but the price to your character's progressions will take quite a step backward. You could have a comrade resurrect you by either magic or healing... or you may be lucky enough to have consumed a resurrection potion before your demise. Lastly, you could simply take your soul and search the land for a healer or shrine from where you can get yourself resurrected. For this to occur, a healer will ask for a donation for such services... or a shrine will demand tribute to the gods. You will need to have some gold saved in your bank box in order to take advantage of this. You can get resurrected without the fee or penalties if your total stats are 90 or less, and your skill total is 200 or less.<br><br>RULES: This world is fully set for player versus player interaction, but that does not mean you have to cause grief for other players. Keep the in world fighting amongst each other to a level that does not cross the borders of harassment. Although you may have multiple accounts, I urge you to simply use one or two accounts. Each account has the ability to build many homes and it is easy enough to get bulk order deeds without resorting to multiple accounts. This is a simple fantasy sandbox world where you can explore and do what you will. Choose a decent fantasy themed name for your character.<br><br>FINALLY: This should give you more than enough information to start your adventure in this world. Explore and try out different things and you will discover many options that are available to your character. One of the first pieces of advice would be to seek out a sage as they sell valuable information that can help you learn more about how things function. They have scrolls that contain information on how to blacksmith, tailor, or find resources out in the world by digging or skinning animals. You can learn how to chop wood, steal from dungeons, avoiding traps, and even about the different types of reagents. Figure out how you are going to get food and drink as you will need it for your journey. Good luck in your adventures!"; }

Vordo, one of his highest mages, worked for years to perfect the spell that eventually swallowed the small island of Kuldar near the Serpent Island. The gargoyles feared the Black Knight's power as they believed the island to be destroyed. The truth was something far more sinister. Within the mystical bottle the island sits floating in the water that houses the life that was brought with it. The Black Knight exiled some of his prisoners to the bottle to live out their remaining years. Centuries passed and those prisoners farmed land, built a city, had children, and lived in prosperity. Vordo decided that he wanted to rule this land as the Black Knight rules his. He told the Black Knight that the bottle was destroyed in an accident, where the Black Knight cared very little since he was onto other matters of interest. Vordo dropped his castle into the bottle, where it crashed down next to the city within. He magically entered the bottle and summoned a moongate to leave one day if he wished. He ruled with an iron fist for almost a decade until the citizens rose up and brought an end to his tyranny. They sealed off his castle and locked whatever horrors Vordo created inside. Legends tell of his ghost roaming these halls, where he carries the notes that would allow him to leave the bottle.

Apparently they are used for some types of spell casting. They happily take donations, but if an apprentice were to offer them 20 or more, they are often given a gift. It doesn't matter if you practice magic, or dark magic, as long as you reached the apprentice level of skill in such fields. There was something also similar I heard from another spellcaster that the guildmaster of black magic has a liking for star sapphires. I found none of those. During my last journey, I found 23 rubies in a metal chest, and gave them to the wizard guildmaster. He gave me a crystal ball, that summons a familiar to serve me. It doesn't do much in regards to services, but it will carry some of my things for me and keep me company. The crystal ball only had 5 charges, but the mage guildmasters can be hired to charge it further. I was given an imp for a traveling companion, but I wanted a black cat. I gave the crystal ball back to the mage, where he gave me another to look at. I simply kept passing them back to him until I got the cat I sought. The mage told me that I could use colors from common dye tubs, and pour it on the crystal ball. It would retain the color, and thus the familiar would share that color. He was right.

He found the tunnel that leads to this world in the frozen lands but would not speak of the exact location. He told tales of a tropical land with the City of Furnace. There he learned the art of creating statues from stone and the ability to turn sand into glass to make other items. What intrigues me is that I have sent agents from the Thieves’ Guild to follow him to see if they can discover the location of the tunnel. They believe they found it in the mountains of the frozen lands, but the surrounding mountains are too treacherous to climb. They have witnessed Zekylis magically appear on top of the tower, so he must have a way to reach the tower from a portal elsewhere. Years have passed since learning anything new. It was only by accident that a hunter was at the Sleepy Island Inn, telling tales of a crazy wizard living in the nearby jungle of Umber Veil. Word got back to the Thieves’ Guild and they found the home of Zekylis. Apparently he married a woman from Renika, named Lilly. She apparently died from a giant serpent bite and was buried next to the home. Her parents are also buried there as they must have died from old age. A spy hid in the shadows nearby, watching and listening. Late one night, Zekylis came out of the house and approached Lilly’s grave. The spy had to duck behind the grave stone as not to be discovered. Zekylis stopped in front of her grave and said, ‘I love you Lilly’. The spy waited for quite some time and did not hear Zekylis walk away. Growing weary, the spy peaked around and saw that Zekylis was gone. He never returned to his home and it is as if he vanished without a trace. Magic jewels were found in his home but the effects could never be determined.

They require 7500 available soul force to purchase. Like wands, they have charges and do not incur mana cost on use. Once the charges of a soul shard have expired, a soulbound being can draw power from their vault by using it and then targeting the shard.<br><br>Of course, this will result in the underlying power of the vault diminishing slightly.<br><br>There are two types of soul shards, a white shard and a prismatic shard. White shards provide a greater healing spell, prismatic shards provide a range of offensive magery spells with enhanced damage. To receive either soul shard, you can find them on page three of the mamina manu imbuement.<br><br>Other Items of interest:<br>Blood liches are capable of placing their blood inside a recall rune, transforming it into a blood rune. These blood rune's are then used by the blood lich to teleport back to a location where they can conduct their mamina manu incantation.  You too can do this, with the help of the blood lich. You can attain these from them for 2500 soul force. <br><br>Finally, mortal, for the braver heroes, old urns exist which contain ancient soulbinding creatures. One such creature is called a blood monarch, these are incredibly powerful forms of liches, as they have the power of their vault with them.  If you are skilled enough to defeat them, they may have unique components on them which you can combine with your vault to increase its power further.

straight, This is tale of a desperate man, a man with no hope, who lives.... lived in Widows Keep.<BR> Who I was before the strangeness started hardly seems to matter now, but I am a woodsman at the keep and though I dabble in writing the outdoors is my real home, and I often spend days far away from its walls, maybe id have been able to do something if id been hear when it first started but.... its sure as hell to late for regrets now, so I am recording what I know before I try and escape, in case it may help another learn of the evil of this, as I hold no hope of success in my heart.<BR>The first I knew of the troubles of my home was when I returned to find my wife was dead... 2 days prior to my return I was told she had passed, I cried in pain unable to believe it at the time, As she had been so healthy and happy when I had left, as if it was the worst thing that could have happened.<BR> My sadness it seems was not to be solitary however as there had been a rash of disappearances in the local area in my absence, and tails of newly abandoned farm's in the area had come to town carried by the few travellers that had been passing through as of late.<BR>Worse a day later mysterious omen's began to appear all around the keep as if brought on by my return, strange noises and a terrible smell drifted around the solemn silence of the night, And an un-natural stillness beset the day bereft of the common birdsong and other noises of the countryside.<BR> Then maybe a week later came the tales of apparitions, shadows where there should be none, faces reflected in windows that had no origin, and figures walking among the tree’s in the distance that vanished as they passed between one trunk and another.<BR> Then the stories of her replaced all other’s, Stories of a beautiful woman that would appear in town at night and of her beguiling influence, they said she would enslave those she came across and those enthralled would cast aside caution and follow her willingly, never to be seen again.<BR> At first the townsfolk hid from the truth.... myself included, we all claimed that these story’s where a fantasy, that the disappearances where something natural or simply because those missing had run away, despite the witness’s claims.<BR> But within a few weeks too many had gone missing and it was no longer just the poor and homeless, The lure of the Well had stolen the Earl's son in broad daylight and the guards could ignore it no longer so a rescue was planned, the Captain of the guard, 3 of his best men and a few volunteers went, but within a few days it was clear none would return.<BR> With this, A new and terrible mania struck the Citizenry, many wanted to flee but the apparitions once held within the tree line now lumbered seemingly at random around in plain view all around us outside the walls, and many of there number where recognisable as our friends and… previous neighbours, there skin now seemingly pale and torn, those that did leave where mobbed and it seemed joined their new dishevelled fellows, rising again within minuets to randomly wonder the fields aimlessly.<BR> We fortified all that we could as the shambling mass slowly came closer to the walls and gate over a few days, we picked off a few with arrows but soon decided to keep what stored ammunition we had reserved as it didetn seem to thin the hord, shockingly they began clawing and pulling at the weak points in the keep’s fortifications as they came across them, and with far more intelligence than their shambling demeanour portrayed ignored any attempts we made to draw them away or distract them.<BR> That night the horror came 4 fold, Firstly the jungle surged towards us, trees bending and pointing towards the keep all around like a maw of wooden teeth closing apon us, Second the moon bright and full in the sky turned blood red in a chilling instant, the light pieced the mist illuminating the full terrifying extent of our enemy, Thirdly with this the dead begin to wail and shriek, also surging forwards there attacks became targeted and relentless rather than the seemingly coincidental assaults of the past few days.<BR> Then lastly she came, her wail joining the others in a crescendo, and as she approached the gate the horde before her pressed hard against it and passed through it as if only glass barred there way.<BR>  All knew it was the end in that instant unseen groups of assailants had been scaling the walls and the tide came at us from all sides as the gate crashed open, some of us fell to their knees and dropped there weapons crying for salvation, men threw themselves at the enemy to hold them back as others ran for the inner keep, I ran with them and I hid… its been hours and the screams have stopped now but the wail goes on, soon ill try and make a break for the well, I doubt its any safer but if the dead are all up hear maybe I can find a way through and… well I don’t have any other better idea’s<BR> Ill be with you Sarah, wait up for me.";}
