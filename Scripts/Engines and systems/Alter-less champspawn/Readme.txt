OSI Style Labyrinth Champion Spawn

by: Denjiki

Based off of Gizmo's old Labyrinth script with some of my own additions.

Unzip Minotaur.cs, minotaurcaptain.cs, minotaurscout.cs, and tormented minotaur.cs into servuo dir\scripts\mobiles\monsters\ML\humanoid\melee and replace the old files. 

Unzip Meraktus.cs into servuo dir\scripts\mobiles\monsters\ml\special\

Unzip Labyrinth.cs into your servuo\custom systems folder. I created a folder in custom systems called OSILabyrinth, but you can make one with whatever name you want.


Also, if you open up Labyrinth.cs, you will see a line not too far down that says private const int m_KillsToAppear = 50; you can change the 50 to whatever you want, it is the kills required for the Meraktus champion to spawn. 

Done!
