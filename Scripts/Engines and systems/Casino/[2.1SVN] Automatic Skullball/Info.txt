Automatic Skullball

What is Skullball?
Skullball is the UO version of Soccer. There are two teams, two nets, and 1 ball. The players dribble/kick the ball around, and whoever gets the ball into the opposing team's goal, scores.


The ball is moved in the direction they are traveling by running it over. 


Whichever team gets to 10 first wins.


What is Automatic about this?
This version of Skullball is Automatic in the sense that it is 1-click to setup, and then your done. The game is also entirely self-perpetuating (you won't need to micromanage the game).

**** UPDATE! ****
***************************************************************************************
[9/27/2011]
Using the feedback I've received thus far, I've updated the system to allow further customization.
New Features Include:
Using the variable "GiveRewardMinTeamCount = #;" you can now adjust the minimum players which must be on the field in order for a handout to be awarded.


Using the following three variables:
DisplayDateOnReward = true/fasle;
DisplayNameOnReward = true/false;
DisplayTeamCountOnReward = true/false;
You can now alter the information given on the reward statue's name. You can add/remove the players Name, the Date/Time, and/or the Team Count ( looks like "[5v4]" ).


All 4 of these new variables are accessible within the game via the Props Menu.


And Most Importantly:
I've fixed the serialization/deserialization to properly save all of your settings!

Let the games begin!
