FinalTwist comissioned Juzzver to create this script.
initial script by Juzzver, modifications by FinalTwist

Here's how to set up your own Guantlet:

(if you want to place your own)
as an admin, type
[premiumspawner gauntletmaster
place the NPC where you want him to be

[props him
you will see a few locations that need to be set
spawnarea, playerrespoint, playerstartpoint

the spawn area need to be set as a square, NW point first (start) and SE point second (finish)
you should see the arena markers around the area

if you do not, note that the markers are moved to ground level.  you will need to move them to the proper height
to move the markers up or down to Z level 20, type

[area set z 20 where losblocker name != null

[area set z 20 where blocker name != null
in both cases select an area wider than the gauntlet arena.

if you messed up and want to delete the markers, type 
[area delete where blocker name != null

[area delete where losblocker name != null

to change the number of enemies, find in gauntletmaster.cs
m_MaxWaveKills = 100 / (m_Wave == 0 ? 1 : m_Wave);
change 100 (or whatever it is in the script) to the amount you want

To change the reward reward look in in:

MBRewardBox.cs


To set or change groups of mobs you can here:

MonstersBashSpawnInfo.cs


To change the points per kill, change this params for each array: 
new int[] {50, 70, 80, 100}


To add new gauntlet waves type, you will need add new types here 
MonstersBashEventNPC.cs 
in:

	public enum MonstersBashType
