// Here you can add custom Avatars to the chat system!
// Avatars appear in player profiles and private messages, and are limited to
//  images available within Ultime Online's data files.  If you aren't familiar
//  with how to access these, I suggest you not use this file.  If you are curious,
//  see if you can find the program InsideUO.  Improper IDs can cause client crashes.
//  NOTE:  Be sure you use the Integer ID value.
// TO USE THIS:  Place your ChatAvatars.txt file in your RunUO/Data folder.

// Unlike the other customizing text files, this requires multiple lines to add an
//  Avatar.  Not following these directions will skew the results.
// Three pieces of information are required for Avatars:

// Image ID
// X Offset
// Y Offset

// The offsets change the position of the image within the circle Avatar background.
// If your Image ID is above 100,000, it will use ItemIDs instead of Menu art.
// I personally like to center them, but that is your decision.  You may have to
//  play with the offsets to get the image in the right place.  You can seperate
//  your custom entries with blank spaces to make it easily readable.  Here's an
//  example:

105
8
8

106
8
8

// Both of these entries already exist so they will be ignored by the system.
// Now it's your turn, place all your custom Avatars above the 'EndOfFile' tag.
