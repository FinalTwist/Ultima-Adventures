// The Help Contents menu can be found in game by either typing [HelpContents
//  or pressing the '?' button on the chat gump in game.  While I use it to
//  provide help for the chat system, it can also be used by you to give info
//  about your shard!

// Here you can add new Help Contents entries!  The process is very simple.
// Each entry has two lines.  The first is the Subject, the second the Details.
// Here's a good example:

Contact Knives
You can email me at kmwill23@hotmail.com, or visit www.runuo.com and leave me a private message.  My MSN address is also kmwill23@hotmail.com.

// The first line, Contact Knives, will appear as a selectable subject.
// The second line will appear when the player selects the subject entry.
// Be careful when you add entries!  If you don't add two lines of text,
//  it won't appear in the Help Contents menu.  You can also apply updates to
//  this file in game through the General Options menu.  Press Relad Help Contents.
// Now go forth and add help contents!  Good idea to add them at the bottom.

Public Chat
Unless changed by your shard administrators, to use public chat begin your chat with '[c'.  Try this: [c Hello world!

For faster PMing, try turning on the Quickbar by pressing the 'Q' button on the main Chat menu.  Then you can click the little 'm' button next to the player.  If you can't see either of these, then they aren't allowing messages from you.  This can be an ignore or they could require you to be friends first.<br><br>You can also use the command '[pm <name>' for ultra-fast PMing!

Mail
By typing '[ma' you can access all your stored private message, which display kind of like an email list.  From here you can view old messages, reply to them again, or delete them.  You have many different mail options available to you: Auto deleting, friends only, friend online alert, read receipts, and received sounds.  Check them out!

Auto delete week old messages
