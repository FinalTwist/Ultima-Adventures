// Here you can add new text colors to the gump customization!
// This system uses RGB values to determine its text colors, just like HTML.
//  If you don't understand how to use RGB (RedGreenBlue), you can either
//  Google them to get a color listing or not use this file at all.  I don't
//  think there is any risk of client crashes with bad entries.
// TO USE THIS:  Place your ChatColors.txt file in your RunUO/Data folder.

// Adding entries here is simple!  You just put the 6 digit integer RGB value
//  on its own line below, like this:

111111

// Since this value already exists in the gump customizations, nothing will happen.
// Now add your custom colors before the 'EndOfFile' tag below!
