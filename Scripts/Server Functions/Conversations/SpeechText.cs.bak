			if ( sConversation == "Ranger"){ sText = "Greetings, " + sYourName +". My name is " + sMyName + ", and I can teach you about surviving the land. Surviving the wilderness is often easier to those that can live by their wits and not the aid of magic. We rangers have no need for magical scrolls or spells of power. We know when to rest, and we know where to rest. We strategically place our camps to rest in complete safety. A well rested adventurer, is an adventurer that returns to tell their tales. If you wish to pursue this life of living off the land, you must practice in the skill of camping. With a bedroll, and a simple camp fire, you can rest safely for the night. You may also make use of small tents. These tents are useful when you find yourself in immediate danger. If you can build your tent fast enough, you can remain safe for a couple of minutes while you prepare yourself for the dangers outside. These types of tents can only be assembled outside, so don't try to use them within the dungeons and tombs.<br><br>Camping tents are what keep the best rangers going for long periods of time. It could be weeks before a ranger returns to a settlement, as camping tents can provide almost anything a ranger needs. For the skilled ranger, a camping tent can provide food and water along with the unlimited safety for rest. Those experts in camping, can build their camping tents and have even more comforts. Enough to draw in other adventurers that may provide you with some of their wares like food, drink, and survival gear. These camping tents can also allow you to organize your items from your bank box. The nicest part of camping tents, is that you can use them while underground. This allows for greater dungeon exploration as you can safely store your found treasure and not overburden yourself. I sometimes sell small tents and camping tents, but you may find them easier from provisioners.<br><br>You can use traps to help hunt for creatures. You can sometimes buy the plain trapping tools, but tinkers can usually make the best trapping tools since they can use metals that cause more damage than plain iron does. Simply use the tools and a trap will be placed at your feet. Although you can avoid your own trap, others may not be able to. The higher your trap removing skill, the more effective your trap will be. If you have trapping tools made from  more precious metals, it would be even more effective.<br><br>Safe travels."; }
			else if ( sConversation == "Shipwright"){ sText = "Greetings, " + sYourName +". My name is " + sMyName + ", and I can teach you about sailing and navigating the high seas. When you are able to finally purchase your own ship, you will be given a deed from which you can have your ship built. Ships may only be placed in water and there must be some type of dock nearby. When you dry dock your ship, you must also be near a dock. When dry docked, you will get a small representation of that ship to carry with you for safe keeping. Take this to any outdoor water source and double click it, where you will then be asked to place it in the water. A key will be placed in your backpack and your bank box to lock and unlock the vessel. If you have recall magic, you can use the key to magically travel to your boat no matter where it is. Now if you own your own home, you may get a 'docking lantern' from me to place in your home. This also assumes that your home is built near a body of water. The 'docking lantern' must be secured in your home. This allows you to launch, or dry dock, a ship near that home. You can even set the security on the lantern so only certain people you trust can make use of its light.<br><br>You may paint your ship whatever color you want, but keep in mind that the entire ship will have the color you paint it. Use any method you would to dye items on your ship that is in your pack. When you place the ship in the water, it will have that color. I have seen some horrific looking ships because of this, but it does allow you to have a ghostly looking ship or even an evil dark ship on the high seas. No matter if on the water, or in your possession, the ship will maintain the color in which is it painted.<br><br>As for sailing the ship, you must be on the deck of your boat to pilot her. Double click the tillerman and a window will appear that will allow you to navigate the ship. You may place this window over your mini-map for better navigation. You will notice red diamonds on the different directionals. Select these to move the boat in that direction. Don't forget to raise the anchor first. This can be done on the wooden placard. There you can drop or raise the anchor. You can rename your ship to whatever you want. Lastly, you can set the speed of your ship to either full speed, or move alone a step at a time. On the placard, there are three triangle arrows. There is one on the left, one on the right, and one on the bottom. Selecting the left or right ones will turn your ship in that direction. Selecting the bottom one will make your vessel come about. There is a red flag attached to the placard. Selecting this will stop your ship. There is a gray tab on the right of the placard. Selecting this will switch this window from one map size to another. If you wish to dry dock your ship, make sure the hold is empty as well as the deck. While on shore, double click the tillerman and he will ask you if you wish to dry dock the ship.<br><br>If you have a sea chart from a cartographer, you can use it to plot a course. After you plot the course on the map, give it to the tillerman. Once he exclaims 'a map!', he will give it back to you and you can simply say 'start'. The tillerman will follow the course you set on the sea chart.<br><br>There are different sizes and styles of ship. The type you acquire matters little. The larger ships allow you to have more passengers, and the hold size greatly increases the bigger the ship. Some like to sail the world and flaunt their wealth. Others merely seek adventure on the high seas. A few seek only to relax and fish. Abandoned boats will only last about 30 rises of the sun before the hull rots and it sinks into the sea, so don't leave her alone that long without putting her in dry dock. Be careful out there no matter the reason. Pirates usually sail about and they take no prisoners. May the wind be at your back."; }
			else if ( sConversation == "Banker"){ sText = "Welcome to our bank, " + sYourName +". My name is " + sMyName + ", and if you need to have some currency converted, I can help you with that. Usually, merchants do not deal in anything other than gold coins. Adventurers often come across coins from the old days. Coins like copper and silver are not too uncommon when one is looking. We usually take the copper and silver, melt it down, and sell it to local blacksmiths. We will trade you 1 gold coin for every 5 silver coins you bring to us. We will also trade 1 gold coin for every 10 copper coins you bring us. This may sound unfair, but you will not find another way to part with those coins. Simply give us a stack of coins and we will convert it for you. You may also put the coins in your bank box, double click the stack, and they will be converted as well. If you happen to find piles of jewels, we will convert those for you as well since the local jeweler often comes by to barter for them. You will know when you find these as they are the size of most coins but vary in color. Don't mistake jewels for gems like diamonds and sapphires. Jewels are found in piles like coins. For every jewel you bring here, we will give you 2 gold for each.<br><br>We also deal in some types of stones and crystals you may stumble upon. Gold nuggets are something we can turn into coins for you, and we do not mean gold ore. Gold nuggets have a shimmering glow to them. You may also find gemstones, which are different than jewels or common stones like diamonds. We will give you 2 gold coins for each of your gemstones as we use that currency with some other kingdoms far away. Crystals are another form of currency that we sometimes use with beings from other planes of existence, so we are greatly interested in them since they are very hard to find. Some claim they have mined for them in the Mines of Morinia, but nobody seems to return to tell the truth of such tales. They are shimmering red in color and we will gladly give you 5 gold for each crystal you find.<br><br>This may sound a little odd, but there are coins we are seeing that are bright green in color. Adventurers claim they find them in some ancient castle that fell from the sky centuries ago. If you find these coins, we will gladly give you 3 gold for each one you find. They are quite rare so the chances of you finding them are unlikely. One more thing, do you need a safe for your home? We sell safes that let you access your bank account from your home. They cost a great amount of gold, but we sell them nonetheless."; }

My name is " + sMyName + ", and if you happen to come across anything unusual in your adventures, I may want to have a look at it. I can pay well if you find rare items like vases, paintings, statues, banners, or carpets. There are other rare items you may discover like unusual reagents that an alchemist may want, strange armor or shields that armorers may seek, unusual decorative weapons that a weaponsmith would show interest, or rare books that scribes would love to read. You could perhaps find ancient scrolls of strange spells that you could never decipher, but a mage will pay greatly for. Stone tablets of long forgotten text may be sought by sages. Special cloth could be traded to a tailor or incredible leather would be interesting to a leatherworker. Finding piles of strange furs would be something that a furtrader would desire, where bards often love adding ancient instruments to their collection. Even finding a finely ages keg of ale would be greatly accepted by the local tavern. Whenever you find these items, you can either keep it for yourself or give it to one of us local merchants that would want the item. You will be given gold commensurate for the value and rarity of the item. Those that are skilled merchants or arms dealers would often get more gold than the average adventurer.";

Bring the book back to me when you find all of the antiques and I will reward you with " + MuseumBook.QuestValue() + " gold.

Those skilled in stealing can take many things from dungeons that no one else can. You may find it worthwhile.<br><br>Teaching yourself how to stealth around can be quite the test of skill, as long as you achieve a 30.0 in hiding. In order to get more proficient, you need to attempt to stealth in heavier armor as you get better with the skill. Here are some examples of items you can wear for the corresponding skill range you are currently trying to achieve:<br><br>30.0-57.4:<br>   - Leather Gorget<br>   - Leather Gloves<br><br>57.4-65.0:<br>   - Ringmail Gloves<br>   - Leather Sleeves<br>   - Leather Gorget<br><br>65.0-84.5:<br>   - Ringmail Gloves<br>   - Ringmail Sleeves<br>   - Leather Gorget<br><br>84.5-95.0:<br>   - Ringmail Gloves<br>   - Ringmail Leggings<br>   - Leather Tunic<br>   - Studded Sleeves<br>   - Studded Gorget<br><br>95.0-100:<br>   - Leather Leggings<br>   - Chainmail Tunic<br>   - Studded Gorget<br>   - Leather Cap<br><br>100-120:<br>   - Chainmail Tunic<br>   - Ringmail Sleeves<br>   - Platemail Gorget<br><br>You can use traps to help catch unsuspecting travelers off guard.

Simply use the tools and a trap will be placed at your feet. Although you can avoid your own trap, others may not be able to. The higher your trap removing skill, the more effective your trap will be. If you have trapping tools made from more precious metals, it would be even more effective.<br><br>Now let me tell you about the towns and cities. We wouldn't be a thieves guild without lightening the purses of the local citizens. This is a tricky venture, but the merchants do carry gold in their pockets and coffers. You just need to snoop the merchant or coffer to see if there is gold to steal. If the merchant has gold, you can try to steal it. If the coffer has gold, then use your stealing skill on the coffer itself. Try not to get noticed because you may have the guards called on you.<br><br>Lastly, if you want to do some shady jobs for our more prominent clientele, then whisper to my guildmaster and they will give you a job to undertake. These are not limited to guild members, as any able thief can do them. You will be given a message of what you need to steal and where it can be found. These are unusual tasks because no one wants to be witnessed exchanging such items, so you will always be given instructions on what city you need to take the item to. Once dropped of, your reward will be waiting along with another job you can do if you want.<br><br>Be careful out there. Keep in mind that you can get a sneak attack on your enemies if you attack them while hidden. Performing such attacks will test your skills in hiding and stealth to increase the damage for the attack. Powerful foes would be best dealt with if you greet them with such a strike."; }

Some of these garments can look unusual to what I normally sell, but I can make them look normal for you. If you manage to get yourself a hood or cowl, they can sometime have their color changed. Just use it when it is on your head. You can select something you are equipped with, like a robe, and it will change its color to match. This allows you to easily set your dress with a hooded robe or cloak."; }

There are many spellcasters that seek mystical power, but the only way to obtain such things is to explore the forgotten dungeons of the land. If you find any unusual scrolls, you can hire me to tell you what they are. It may make your spell book more complete. Also keep in mind that you can outwardly hold certain spell books in your trinket spot. This comes as a benefit if your spell book has properties that go beyond the normal bounds.<br><br>Also, if you come across any strange parchments, you can hire me and I will decipher them for you. I charge 100 gold for that service, as it is more difficult to figure out these strangely written riddles or letters. These parchments often have clues or riddles that lead to many strange and richly things...but half of the time they are simply false or misleading. I am not the only one that can figure out what parchments say. A very intelligent adventurer could also figure it out as well. Parchments may be plainly coded (20 int), expertly coded (30 int), adeptly coded (40 int), cleverly coded (50 int), deviously coded (60 int), ingeniously coded (70 int), or diabolically coded (80 int). Whether the information on it is true or false, I could not tell you...but maybe a gypsy could shed some light on it for you.<br><br>If you want some librarian duties, and you are practicing inscription, there are many books and bookshelves in the dangerous areas of the land you may want to investigate. You will need a monocle, which you could perhaps purchase or have a glass blower create for you. Some have simply come across them. These monocles will help you search the books and bookshelves in dungeons, for example. Simply use a monocole on a shelf or book pile to investigate it further. Monocles wear out, so be sure to bring enough with you if you go on a lengthy research journey. Searching these books and bookshelves may yield blank scrolls as well as scrolls of a magical nature. You can also perhaps find rare books as well.<br><br>If you are a wizard or necromancer, and wish to perform research to increase your knowledge in the ancient forms of magic, I can sell you a research pack to hold all of your research materials. Not only can you research the ancient forms of magic, but you can also research widely known spells that you may have difficulty finding the original spell. Research requires one to search the world for ancient wizard tomes of information to construct the spells. You must also become very proficient in inscription to research and scribe the new magic you learn about.

The 'create food' spell not only creates food but also creates a mystical bottle of water. Make sure to eat and drink during your journey. The 'remove trap' spell should not be overlooked. It does more than simply remove traps from containers. It also will create a magical wand that goes in your backpack. This wand will passively check for traps on the floors and walls...along with those placed on containers. The 'telekinesis' spell allows you to pick up an object, that is out of your reach, and place it in your backpack. It does not work on stacked items, or items in another container. Some dungeons have hidden traps and chests within them.

What makes the standard homes unique is that you can paint them before you build them. Simply use something to dye the contract a color of your choosing. When you build the home, it will totally be in that particular color. Of course I have seen some horrible looking homes that have been painted, but this does allow you to build structures like a dark tower or a blood red castle.

One of the rarest forms of bardic performances are usually in a bard's song book. Although I might have an empty book for sale, the songs are something of a lost art.

You can call forth the magic from your book, or use the song bars as explained by using the 'Help' button on the paperdoll. Unlike other types of magic, bardic songs do have a command you can type for each song. This command is something similar to '[KnightsMinne', and you can see which command goes with which song in your bardic song book. Many of these songs effectiveness is dependent on the bard's knowledge of music. The best results of these songs are performed by those that are good at musicianship, provocation, discordance, and peacemaking. You also need an instrument to play these songs. The bardic song book will have your set your instrument of choice. If you lose the instrument, simply open the book and assign a new instrument.

Henchman are followers that can join you on adventures so you do not have to traverse the dangerous dungeons alone. You can purchase the services of a henchman from barkeeps, tavern keepers, or inn keepers. There are three different types of henchman you can have...a fighter, archer, or wizard. These henchman use a similar system for tamed animals, with a few exceptions. First, you can heal your henchmen with your healing skill. Second, you cannot transfer an active henchman to another player. Third, you cannot stable your henchmen. Lastly, you cannot be bonded to your henchmen. Each 'henchman item' represents the type of henchman you have (helms for fighters, crossbows for archers, or crystal balls for wizards). Although you cannot transfer your henchman, you can give the 'henchman item' to another person where they will then have possession of the henchman. Along those lines, if someone else manages to get your 'henchman item' from you, the henchman is then theirs.<br><br>You must be in an area such as an inn, tavern, or home to call your henchman. Once you call them, they will take possession of the 'henchman item' and keep it until one of the following occur...they are killed, you release them, or they get annoyed with the lack of treasure being found. For every 5 gold you give them, they will travel with you for 1 minute. This equals to 300 gold per hour, where the maximum they will take from you is enough for 6 hours of adventuring. You can pay your henchman in a few different ways. You can give them many types of treasure like coins, gems, or rare items for payment. Rare items are those unique items you may find that you can give to merchants in towns for a high price. Each time you pay them, you will get a message indicating how many minutes they will be traveling with you. When they have about 5 minutes left, they will begin to express their annoyance for the lack of treasure. This is a warning to find some treasure quickly, or your henchman will leave. If your henchman does depart, the 'henchman item' will appear in your backpack. The next time you call upon your henchman, make sure you have something to give them so they will travel with you. A henchman always remembers how much treasure you have given them. This means if a henchman has about 4 hours left of travel, and you 'release' them, they will remember that they have 4 hours of travel when you call upon them again. Keep in mind that this 'adventuring time' does not count down when you are in an area like a tavern, home, inn, bank, or camping tent.<br><br>Each henchman will have a unique name, title, and clothing. If you do not care for your henchman's appearance, simply give the 'henchman item' to an innkeeper, tavern keeper, or barkeeper and they will exchange the henchman for another one. When you do this, the new henchman will retain any bandages and time remaining for adventuring the previous henchman had...as payments and bandages are transferred to the new henchman. As mentioned earlier, you do not stable henchmen. You instead 'release' them and their 'henchman item' will appear in your backpack and you can call the henchman later. You can release henchman anywhere you are. If a henchman is slain, the 'henchman item' will appear in your backpack. The name of the 'henchman item' will indicate that the henchman is dead. You will have to seek out a healer and 'hire' them to resurrect your henchman. When you 'hire' a healer to do this, it will cost an amount of gold indicated on the item...and you must select the 'henchman item' when the targeting cursor comes up. The 'dead' indicator will vanish and you can then return to an area like an inn, tavern, bank, or home and call your henchman again.<br><br>If you ever mount a creature or magically enhance your travel speed, your henchman will mount a steed shortly after so they can keep up with you. Henchman are only as able of an adventurer as you are. Their skill level is an average value of your total skills. Their stats are a distribution of your total non-magically-enhanced stats. So basically, the better you are...the better your henchmen will be. These henchmen only help you in your battles. They do not pick locks or remove traps. That is up to you to manage. You can give them bandages and they will use them as they need them to cure their poison or heal their wounds. If you ever want to know how many bandages they have left in their pack, simply say 'report' and they will tell you. You can give them potions though and they will drink them...giving you an empty bottle back. The potions they can make use of are heal, cure, rejuvenate, refresh, and mana potions.
