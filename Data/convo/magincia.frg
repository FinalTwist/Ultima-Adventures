      "I saw a combat mage on his way to Trinsic once. Said he was going to teach battle magic to the paladins.",
      "I met a man from Jhelom who said that Trinsic buys war horses like a shepherd buys apples!",
      "It's too smart for me there by half, and that's the truth. Trinsic is all engineers from Britain and Minoc and Moonglow. I'd be feared to speak for soundin' stupid.",
      "I don't know much about Trinsic. I think they make paladins or palaquins or something.",

      "There's only hard-edged rational folks in Jhelom. They've no use for mages, but a magic weapon or potion will fetch a fine price most days.",
      "They need a fair amount of goods in Jhelom. They once tried to set up a colony - called New Jhelom - to grow their goods for 'em. It didn't work out. Now it's called Nujel'm and 'tis a nasty wicked place.",

      "It's a disgusting place. Nujel'm has no respect for decency. I've been there three times, and I know!",
      "Nujel'm's in no danger. So many ambassadors and lordlings spend their leisure hours there that all the lands would rise up to defend it.",
      "'Tis a foul place, ruled by the get of pirates and pillagers.",
      "'Twas a den of thieves once. Now Nujel'm has merchants, not cutthroats, who take all thy gold.",
      "I heard that on the island of Nujel'm, giving money to someone other than a Nujellan is punishable by death!",
      "The only thing free on Nujel'm is air, and any mage who conjures a way to charge gold for breathing will be hailed as a savior.",
