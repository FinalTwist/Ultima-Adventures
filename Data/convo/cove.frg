      "We can never tell when a raid will come from the orcs' fort. Sometimes it is in the day, sometimes it is by moonlight.",
      "When caught in the open, villagers are powerless against the orcs. We certainly dare not attack the fort to the south."
}
    #Key "*fort*" {
      "The orcs have a fortress not too far from here, to the south.",

      "Our lighthouse stands proud and straight to the north of the village ... not even a long walk's distance.",
      "Cove's lighthouse is our only notable landmark. Thou might say that light is our only export!",
      "Our lighthouse, if truth be known, is as much a watch tower as aught else. The orcs make this dangerous territory!"
}

      "Docks? It depends, friend, on what thy need is. Cove has a dock, but then so do the orcs down south of the village.",

      "Britain? 'Tis the capital of the whole wide world, o'course. Sits on the shore of Britanny Bay way off yonder.",
      "Britain isn't so much as some folks thinks it is. They got lots of everything, but 'tis all flash and bother. Shiny nonsense....",
      "A place of magic, is Britain. Some say they invent a new spell every day. Don't know how they could use that many ....",

      "Someday I'll go to Britain again, maybe settle down. They've got everything there ... games and shoppes and magic and just everything.",
      "Britain was the first place where people are judged according to their own accomplishments, not their fathers'. 'Tis a tricky thing to make work, I'd imagine.",
      "'Tis  the very center upon which all ill-natured rogues converge. They seek to destroy what they cannot understand.",
      "Britain? Seems a nice place, from what all I've heard.",
      "Britain? Been once. Quite big.",
      "Oh, posh. Britain's a place for swelled heads. All art and music and dilly dancin'. Bet there's not a soul there who likes rutabagas for breakfast.",

      "I saw a combat mage on his way to Trinsic once. Said he was going to teach battle magic to the paladins.",
      "I met a man from Jhelom who said that Trinsic buys war horses like a shepherd buys apples!",
      "It's too smart for me there by half, and that's the truth. Trinsic is all engineers from Britain and Minoc and Moonglow. I'd be feared to speak for soundin' stupid.",
      "I don't know much about Trinsic. I think they make paladins or palaquins or something.",
      "Trinsic is a tough place. The whole thing is warriors, and the rest is city guards.",

      "Trinsic? 'Tis the land's guardian, a city that teaches paladins the ways of honor and virtue.",

      "Jhelom 'tis the very place to go if thou'rt looking to hire mercenaries.",
      "An overabundance of mercenaries are found in Jhelom ... and the shops and other establishments that serve them that fight for a living.",
      "My sister lived in Jhelom for near on two years. She didn't like it ... too harsh for her tastes. All steel and iron, no silks and satins.",
      "There's only hard-edged rational folks in Jhelom. They've no use for mages, but a magic weapon or potion will fetch a fine price most days.",
      "They need a fair amount of goods in Jhelom. They once tried to set up a colony - called New Jhelom - to grow their goods for 'em. It didn't work out. Now it's called Nujel'm and 'tis a nasty wicked place.",
      "There's not a lot of natural good to be grown or mined at Jhelom. Rocky, thou knowest.",
      "Jhelom? They breed and train the best horses in the realm. Famous for it.",
      "'T'ain't no horse better than a Valorian steed from Jhelom. Best war-mount a warrior could want.",
      "Jhelom? Pah! 'Tis a militocracy. Only ex-generals can rule, or some such nonsense.",
      "'Tis very like Trinsic and Serpent's Hold. If thou likes one, thou wilt enjoy t'other.",
      "Jhelom sounds dangerous to me. Everybody's armed and 'tis said they'll challenge thee to a duel for no good reason.",
      "They're very daring in Jhelom. Good swordsmen and skilled riders.",
      "Thou'lt do fine in Jhelom. 'Tis only cowards they despise.",
      "Cannot say I care much for the ethics of Jhelom. Watch thy comrade's back, watch thine own. Paranoia, I call it.",
      "I saw a dance from Jhelom once. 'Twas done in Britannia. Looked like hackin' and slashin' and kickin' to me. Take away the music and thou wouldst call it a riot!",
      "Jhelom? Now there is a town without a lick of beauty. Sad, really."

      "My cousin said that in Nujel'm inns, magic makes the beds every morning and polishes the shoes every night. Wonder what the servants do ....",
      "They grow naught but fancy fruit on that Nujel'm island. Everything else has to be brought by ship.",

      "The city guards of Nujel'm are bound to keep peace. They can execute a thief without askin' leave of anybody!",
      "It's a disgusting place. Nujel'm has no respect for decency. I've been there three times, and I know!",
      "Nujel'm's in no danger. So many ambassadors and lordlings spend their leisure hours there that all the lands would rise up to defend it.",
      "'Tis a foul place, ruled by the get of pirates and pillagers.",
      "'Twas a den of thieves once. Now Nujel'm has merchants, not cutthroats, who take all thy gold.",
      "I heard that on the island of Nujel'm, giving money to someone other than a Nujellan is punishable by death!",
      "The only thing free on Nujel'm is air, and any mage who conjures a way to charge gold for breathing will be hailed as a savior.",
      "Evil people walk the streets of Nujel'm. Slavers, assassins and such ilk are treated like regular citizens!",

      "I heard Nujel'm is a beautiful place, full of color and magic.",

      "Moonglow people are too smart by 'alf. They buy other cities' technology and then whack it to bits to see how it works.",
      "Moonglow is a place of new magic. I did hear that most new magic is developed there.",
      "The Lycaeum at Moonglow is famous. Nearly every wizard of any fame at all has studied there.",
      "'Tis a shameful waste that the land around Moonglow is so rich, yet none really till the soil. Might dirty their hands! Pah!",
      "They've got it sweet in Moonglow, thou knowest. All is imported, but not a penny of tariff do they pay!",
      "I heard once that they do not have coin in Moonglow. I know not that I believe it, though.",
      "I met a man from Moonglow once. Like a teacher he was, he knew so much. Too much brains, I'd say ... ",
      "I learned in school that Moonglow's export is knowledge. Hah! I bet not one of them knows half I know.",
      "Did'st thou knowest that Moonglow was beset by pirates and rogues long ago? Never no more, though. The mages keep the freebooters at bay.",
      "'Tis not right, thou knowest. Moonglow is supposed to be for the benefit of the realm, but they get to sit on fancy cushions, whilst folks like thee and me do the real work.",
      "I met a lass from Moonglow last year. Her nose was so high, she'd drown in a rainshower.",
      "'Tis a horrible place, I'm told. No holidays nor celebration feasts at all. 'Interruptions' they call 'em.",
      "Someone told me once that if the fine folk in Moonglow think thou'rt stupid, they'll not so much as let thee on shore!",
      "A scholar once told me that Moonglow people aren't as smart as they think they are.",

      "I often wonder if Cove would be larger if it were not for the orc raids from the south.",

      "I hear the land on Skara Brae is good cropland. They even have rangers to keep the farms safe.",
      "It's bad positioning, that's what it is. Skara Brae is unprotected from any evil that comes from the sea. 'Tis dangerous to sail there.",
      "They be the best shipbuilders in Skara Brae. Except Minoc of course. Maybe Britain, too. Still, they build fine, fast ships!",
      "The rangers in Skara Brae are second to none!",

      "Very clean folk in Skara Brae. I'm told they'd rather bathe than eat, if they had to choose.",
      "I met a lady from Skara Brae once. She said that inside every body is all the 'etheric culmination of the intellect,' with compassion and rationality. Something like that. I lose sleep thinkin' on it.",

      "Thou couldst not swing a fish in Skara Brae without thou slappest two rangers.",

      "I hear Minoc is a booming, thriving town. More money than people, they say.",
      "I'd not go to Minoc myself. There are too many thieves attracted to the new money.",
      "They're very pleased with themselves, in Minoc. I tell thee, there'll be trouble when all the new mines run dry!",
      "From Minoc comes the raw stuffs for building - lumber and metals and such. Their inventors are busy from dawn to dusk. Pity the nearest market is in Vesper.",
      "Must be a curse on Minoc, that they have so much, yet are too far away to best market it. They can't even find trusty mercenaries to guard their caravans.",
